Solution Approach:
==================
- Read the number of terms in the series from the input data input file
- Based on the number of processes run (n) divide the terms in 'n' chunks
- Add the remainder terms in the last process
- In Each process compute the sum of the series of the individual chunks
- Finally reduce them to final answer.

Based on test results with 12000000 terms the series is converging to (PI * PI)/6.


Compilation:
============
> mpic++ 20173071_Q1.cpp


Run:
====
> mpirun -np 6 ./a.out input.txt output.txt
Sum of the Series = 1.644934 | Reference = 1.644934


- Here input.txt has the value of 12000000.
- Output is also saved in output.txt file.
